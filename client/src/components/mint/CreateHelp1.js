              âœ… A little patience. Ethereum transactions take a while to
              propogate and make it into a block. This is part of what makes the
              network secure. At the time of this writing, the average
              transaction time is around ~5 mins, but it could take much longer
              (we've seen up to a few hours but it's not common ðŸ¤ž). The
              transaction hash should pop up underneath the MINT button, and you
              can view the transaction status on Etherscan by clicking it. If
              the transaction fails or anything goes wrong, the appliation will
              display an alert notification. If the green loading bar at the top
              is still going, that means your transaction is still processing.
              DO NOT close the page. Open a new one if you have to. Watch some
              Netflix. Go grab your dehydrated self a glass of H20. But be
              patient and let the network do it's thing. ðŸ˜Œ
